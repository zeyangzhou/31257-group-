## Design Thinking Principles
From the perspective of design thinking principles, the solutions outlined in the discussion topic have the room for improvement. For instance, the company can do a customer survey, focusing on the hobbies and traits of customers. The customers who have done the survey will get a free gift package or voucher. Although this may increase cost, it will allow for attaining more data on the demands and interests of customers at differnt stages. After the survey is completed, the RM profile can be better applied. Also, the dataset of customer database will have more comprehensive expansion. On the other hand, it contains some biases on the part of inbound calls. The score may be affected due to some other elements (service attitude, calling connection etc.) Instead, the score mechanism can be developed more directly. For example, the staff can ask customers if they are  interested in particular packages or express elements  needed to be improved for the package. After that, the thought of customer will be recorded onto the database of customer interests.



## Definition and process of agile methodology
The agile methodology is a project management process, which is mainly used for software development. In this process, customer needs and solutions are developed through the joint efforts of the company, the team, and the customer.
The travel company hopes to develop an information system that will provide the company with services and assistance to their customers. And the system will automatically help customers match travel plans suitable for customers. For example, when a company sells a specific travel package, the system automatically matches suitable customers. Match with Relationship Managers based on client's age, hobbies, etc. This makes it easier for RM to persuade customers to buy products. When company employees use the system, it only takes a very short time to match.
